# mojo-useragent-role-promiseclass

`Mojo::UserAgent::Role::PromiseClass` is a role that can be
added to [Mojo::UserAgent](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojo/UserAgent)
in order to make `get_p()` and friends return enhanced Promises.

Essentially this is a way to not be having to write `$ua->get_p->with_roles('+Stuff')` everywhere.
Instead you just do `$ua->promise_roles('+Stuff')` once and for all when creating the user agent.
